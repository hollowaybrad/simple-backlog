## Future enhancements

* Updated delete modals with Bootstrap styling
* Clickable backlog table fields to edit inline. This was originally done in Angular but I have decided to rebuild with native Javascript and Rails ajax and Turbolink features
* Multiple labels per story
* User security and login
* Email features such as when tasks are completed and options to opt in to different types of email
* Make sure users cannot be deleted if they have stories assigned or any story history, maybe add disable user feature
* About page
